#  Rose Day — A Cinematic Scroll Experience

A handcrafted, cinematic Rose Day website designed to feel **soft, warm, and emotionally intimate**.

This project is not a template or a demo — it is a **story told through light, motion, and silence**. Every scroll reveals a new emotional beat, guided by a living 3D rose that responds gently to the viewer.

---

##  Concept

The idea behind this project was simple:

> A rose should not just be seen — it should be *felt*.

Instead of loud animations or flashy UI, this experience focuses on:

* Calm pacing
* Candlelight warmth
* Subtle motion
* Emotional presence

The rose moves closer as the viewer scrolls, petals and hearts float like passing thoughts, and the scene slowly warms — creating a moment meant to be *lingered in*.

---

##  Key Features

### Cinematic Scroll Direction

* Scroll-driven choreography (no random motion)
* Rose transitions through emotional "poses"
* Smooth inertia-based movement for a heavy, premium feel

### 3D Rose (Three.js)

* Custom `rose.glb` model
* Velvet / porcelain-inspired material
* Soft sheen and warm edge highlights
* Responsive scaling for mobile, tablet, and desktop

### Romantic Atmosphere

* Warm candlelight color grading
* Soft fog and vignette (never pure black)
* Emotion-first lighting (ambient, key, rim, fill)

### Floating Petals & Hearts

* Canvas-based particle system
* Depth-aware motion (foreground / background)
* Petals and hearts behave like drifting thoughts
* Optimized count for mobile and desktop

### Elegant Typography

* Serif-led romantic typography
* Whisper-style text reveal animation
* Spacious, breathable layout

### Sound (Optional)

* Soft ambient background music
* User-controlled (mobile-safe)
* Gentle fade-in / fade-out

---

##  Fully Responsive

The experience is carefully tuned for:

* iPhone (portrait & landscape)
* iPad / tablets
* MacBook & desktop screens

Responsive adjustments include:

* Camera distance & framing
* Rose position per section
* Particle count optimization
* Touch-based parallax on mobile

---

##  Tech Stack

* **HTML5** — semantic structure
* **CSS3** — typography, atmosphere, transitions
* **JavaScript (ES Modules)**
* **Three.js** — 3D rendering & lighting
* **Canvas API** — petals & heart particles

No external UI frameworks were used.

##  How to Run Locally

Because this project uses ES modules and local assets, it must be served via a local server.

### Option 1: Using Python

```bash
python -m http.server
```

Then open:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

### Option 2: VS Code Live Server

* Install **Live Server** extension
* Right-click `index.html` → **Open with Live Server**

---

##  Design Philosophy

* Motion should feel intentional, not playful
* Light should feel warm, not dramatic
* Silence is allowed — not everything needs to move
* Less UI, more emotion

This project was built to feel **personal**, not impressive for the sake of it.

---

## 💌 Ideal Use Cases

* Rose Day / Valentine’s Day greeting
* Personal romantic gift
* Cinematic web experiment
* Creative portfolio highlight
