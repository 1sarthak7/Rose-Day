#  Rose Day 

A handcrafted, cinematic Rose Day website designed to feel **soft, warm, and emotionally intimate**.

This project is not a template or a demo it is a **story told through light, motion, and silence**. Every scroll reveals a new emotional beat, guided by a living 3D rose that responds gently to the viewer.

---

##  Concept

The idea behind this project was simple:

> A rose should not just be seen it should be *felt*.

Instead of loud animations or flashy UI, this experience focuses on:

* Calm pacing
* Candlelight warmth
* Subtle motion
* Emotional presence

##  Tech Stack

* **HTML5** — semantic structure

* **JavaScript (ES Modules)**
* **Three.js** — 3D rendering & lighting
* **Canvas API** — petals & heart particles

No external UI frameworks were used.

* Less UI, more emotion
